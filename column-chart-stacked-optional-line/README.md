Option to Show One Series as Markers/Line

This option allows you to display one selected data series (column) as markers (with the optional addition of a connecting line) rather than a stacked bar. This is useful for showing totals, where stacked bar components go both above and below zero.

You can customize how the selected series is displayed using the following options:

showMarkers (true | false):
Set to true to display markers for each data point in the selected series.

lineSeries (string):
The name of the column (series) to be rendered as markers.

showLine (true | false):
Set to true to draw a line connecting the data points in the selected series.
