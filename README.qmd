The official repository for all publication ready ONS charts. See our [chart menu](https://onsvisual.github.io/Charts/chart-menu/) and [service manual](https://service-manual.ons.gov.uk/data-visualisation) for more guidance on the use of these charts, and of charts more generally.

We currently maintain a separate [map templates repository](https://github.com/ONSvisual/maptemplates).

(NOTE: This repository is still a work in progress.)

## If you want to make a change
Make a branch and name it something descriptive e.g. feature/new-autocomplete. Once you are happy, do a pull request and someone else will review it before it gets merged into main.

## If there's a problem with a template
Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/ONSvisual/Charts/issues) and the team will have a look.

## Guide to updating and placing an initial commit for a chart

- All missing charts can be found in the issues section of the repository. They will have the following format, "[descriptive chart name]: Initial Commit".

- If this issue does not have an active branch and you would like to update and upload the chart please create a branch and you will be responsible for updating and making a pull request for the chart.

### Initial chart commit checklist

- All initial commits of charts must must follow [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) standards and use [D3 v6](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3v6-migration-guide) or higher.
- Before making additions to the `lib` folder please do check the [ONS CDN](https://github.com/ONSdigital/cdn.ons.gov.uk-vendor) as your addition to the lib folder may already to uploaded.
